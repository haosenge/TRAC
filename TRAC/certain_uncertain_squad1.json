The assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction: the total amount of emitted energy increases with temperature according to a definite rule, the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law (1879\u201384). It was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature, such that \"white hot\" is hotter than \"red hot\".
